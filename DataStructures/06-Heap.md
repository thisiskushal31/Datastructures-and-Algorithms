### Heap

Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where any given node is
- always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes. This property is also called max heap property.
- always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes. This property is also called min heap property.
